Simple and Beautiful Weather App using Java.
I am using https://openweathermap.org/ to get all the data using JSON file.

Steps :
First, you have to create a account on it.

Then, generate a a unique API key to get all the data from the JSON file.

Paste you API KEY in LocationCord.java file as

public final static String API_KEY = "81a26c8f0de407b94623e9f43e825679";

API key calling from this website : https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3
The One Call API provides the following weather data for any geographical coordinates:
Current weather
Minute forecast for 1 hour
Hourly forecast for 48 hours
Daily forecast for 8 days
National weather alerts
Historical weather data for 40+ years back (since January 1, 1979)
